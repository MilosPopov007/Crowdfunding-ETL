## Project Summary phases:

* Create an ETL pipeline that moves raw data to a SQL database.
* Extract data from an external file by using Python and Pandas.
* Use regular expressions to extract numbers and text.
* Clean and transform data by using Python and Pandas.
* Design a database and a table schema by using an entity relationship diagram (ERD).
* Load data into a PostgreSQL database.
* Perform data analysis by using SQL queries.

Initial steps in the project included extracting and transforming the raw data from the large Excel file, followed by "clean and transform" steps in the code ( [Crowdfunding-ETL](https://github.com/MilosPopov007/Crowdfunding-ETL/blob/main/Crowdfunding_ETL.ipynb) [Extract-Transform_final_code](https://github.com/MilosPopov007/Crowdfunding-ETL/blob/main/Extract-Transform_final_code.ipynb.ipynb) ).
